Reasons why its a better diabetic care app( different from traditional apps):-

It has an automated mode for measuring sugar levels ie. with the help of AR & also has the option to add data manually.

It not only reminds of the req. insulin dosage but also uses it as a parameter to check your diabetes & also reminds 
the user about how long your current insulin cartirage(320-330ml) will last and when they will needing more.

Another thing which is additional as compared to the other traditional apps is it has a list of trusted & companies which manufacture
insulin along with their contacts to deliver at their doorstep.

(for reference trditional apps like Diabetes M , mySugr etc rest sugar monitering & insulin manager apps)
